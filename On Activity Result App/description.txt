This app has two activities. The functionality of this app is that it asks the user to click a button which will take the user to another activity.
In the next activity, the user will be asked to type some message and after clicking the "Submit Text" button there, the text will be taken from that activity and
shown in a textview in the first activity. This is done through a method called "onActivityResult".
