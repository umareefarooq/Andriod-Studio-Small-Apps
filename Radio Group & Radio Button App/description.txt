This app is about radio group and raadio buttons.
The concept is described by taking the radion group, i.e. gender, which had two radio buttons, i.e. male and female.
wHen the user clicks the "check" button; the app pop ups a toast message showing which gender is selected.
If the user clicks the "check" button without checking any radio button, then the app will show a toast message saying, "select a gender" rather than just crashing.
