Shared Preferences is used to store and retrieve small amounts of primitive data
as key/value pairs to a file on the device.
Primarily used for saving Application Settings & User Information. The data will be available across user sessions even if the application is killed.
These preferences are stored in XML files in the Android file system as follows:

Data/data/<package_name>/shared_prefs/<pref filename>.xml

In this App, the first activity takes some input from the user, which is then saved into a shared preference and also shown in an EditText in the second activity.
