  
This App converts a text input into speech. When the user launches the app, it asks to press the button at the top of the screen.
After presssing the button, the app converts that given text into speech. 

Text to Speech works in three steps:

Step 1 -  Making  the object of texttospeech class

      TextToSpeech t1 = new TextToSpeech(this, new TextToSpeech.OnInitListener(){   });

Step 2 -  Implementation of oninit method within the TextToSpeech object

        
            @Override
            public void onInit(int status) {
                t1.setLanguage(Locale.ENGLISH);
                t1.setPitch(1.0f);
                t1.setSpeechRate(1.0f);
            }
       

Step 3 - Calling Speak method on the text to speech object

        t1.speak(Text, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH,null);
