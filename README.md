   This repositopry contains small Apps and Projects that I have developed in Andriod Studio.

## Activity Life Cycle

   Android Activity Lifecycle is controlled by 7 methods of android.app.Activity class. The android Activity is the subclass of ContextThemeWrapper class.An activity  is the single screen in android. It is like window or frame of Java.By the help of activity, you can place all your UI components or widgets in a single screen.  
          

  

### Android Activity Lifecycle methods

   *Let's see the 7 lifecycle methods of android activity*

1. **onCreate**	is called when activity is first created.
2. **onStart** is called when activity is becoming visible to the user.
3. **onResume**	is called when activity will start interacting with the user.
4. **onPause**	is called when activity is not visible to the user.
5. **onStop** is	called when activity is no longer visible to the user.
6. **onRestart** iscalled after your activity is stopped, prior to start.
7. **onDestroy** iscalled before the activity is destroyed.


## Addition App

   This App simply takes two integirs and them them. the sum of the numbers is shown in the App.
   
## Button Event App
 
   This App has a button, which changes and displayes the text when it is clicked. After clicking the button, some text message is shown in the TextView below.

## Changing Images

   This app has two image views with pictures already in place. Below each image, there is a button, which is used to change the picture when it is clicked.
   And same is the case with the second picture.
   
##  Checkbox & Radio Button App

   This small App takes two user inputs, i.e. the size and color of some given product.
   after checking the radio buttons, and the checkbox, when the user clicks on the "Order" button; the app 
   throws a toast message showing which size and color the user have chosen. right after that, another toast message pops up- showing if the user had click 
   the "I agree to the terms" checkbox or not. Also, if the user try to click the "Order" button without selecting any size and colour, then the app will 
   not crash, but simply show a toast message saying, "Select Size & Colour."
   
## Login App

This App simple contains the Login page without any functionality.
