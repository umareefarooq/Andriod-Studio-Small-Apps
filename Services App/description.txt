      A service is a component that runs in the background & foreground. It can perform long-running operations in the background. It does not provide a user     interface.
      Once started, a service might continue running for some time, even after the user switches to another application or activity.

      In this App, the app has the functionality to play a song in the bacjground.
      
       @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.song);
        mediaPlayer.start();
        return START_STICKY;
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        mediaPlayer.stop();
        super.onDestroy();
    }
