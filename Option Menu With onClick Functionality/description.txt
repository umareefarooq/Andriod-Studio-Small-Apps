For creating an option menu in the app, first create an andriod resourse directory. Within the directory, create a resourse of the type menu class. In that menu type file/resourse, create the items that you want to show in the option menu in the exact same order. After doing so, run the following code in the main activity:

        MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater();
        inflater.inflate(R.menu.main_menu,menu);
        return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
        
This will create an option menu in the app.
