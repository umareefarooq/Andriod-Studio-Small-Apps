This small App takes two user inputs, i.e. the size and color of some given product.
after checking the radio buttons, and the checkbox, when the user clicks on the "Order" button; the app 
throws a toast message showing which size and color the user have chosen. right after that, another toast message
pops up- showing if the user had click the "I agree to the terms" checkbox or not. 
Also, if the user try to click the "Order" button without selecting any size and colour, then the app will not crash,
but simply show a toast message saying, "Select Size & Colour."
