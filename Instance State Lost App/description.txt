This app demonstractes the concept of data lost during the the configuration changes with respect to the activity life cycle.
When an application is running and th phone configuration is changed; i.e. rotating the phone, changing local langugae, and activating multi windowmode etc, then the data received from any sort of event handling is lost. E.g. if the user inputs some data in the text views and is shown on the screen below, then the data after the click event will be lost if the user rotate the phone.
When the configuration is changed, the activity is killed and then restarted. In the event of this, the following methods are executed in the below given order:

OnPause > OnStop > OnDestroy > OnCreate > OnStart > OnResume
